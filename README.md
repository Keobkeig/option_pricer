# Options Pricer
This repository was a project for me to learn more options pricing and technical analysis. 
Believing an optimistic US jobs report in Decemeber 2024 meant a surefire profit, I lost $2K buying calls.
(Turns out, not decreasing interest rates because the employment rate went up meant stock prices go down...)
